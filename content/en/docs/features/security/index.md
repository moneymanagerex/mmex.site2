MMEX is your trusted financial companion that not only prioritizes seamless money management but also places a premium on the security and control of your financial data. Upon installation, the default setting ensures that your data is stored locally, giving you exclusive ownership and control.

For enhanced security, Money Manager EX provides AES encryption, implementing AES128 for the Desktop app and robust AES256 for the Android port. In our continuous commitment to security excellence, the next step involves unifying these encryption standards to AES256, ensuring seamless compatibility with SQLCipher.

Looking ahead, we are dedicated to further strengthening your dataâ€™s protection by considering the implementation of multi-ciphers in the future. This forward-thinking approach reflects our commitment to providing cutting-edge, adaptable encryption features, offering you peace of mind and control over the privacy of your financial records across all platforms
