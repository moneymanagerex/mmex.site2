MMEX allows adding every file as attachments for one of its elements (like transactions, accounts, assets, etc..)

All attachments are copied into a user-defined folder and not simply linked to the original file: in this way, they will remain accessible also if original files are removed and itâ€™s possible to backup all of them simply copying the entire folder.
