You are not tied to a cloud provider. 

You can store your database files using your chosen cloud provider - [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), Google, Microsoft, DropBox, Amazon, etc.

Just locate your database on the shared area provided by your cloud provider and let them look after synchronizing the data to the cloud.
