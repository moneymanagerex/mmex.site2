MMEX allows creating scheduled transactions to track financial activities that occur at once or at regular intervals, such as the payment of a bill or a monthly mortgage.

When one or more schedules are enabled, transactions will be created in your account as by schedules. They are also needed to create cash flow reports with the number of funds available, based on future commitments.

These special transactions:
- Are displayed as reminders on the Dashboard within 15 days of the due date
- Can be set up to activate automatically on the due date
- Can be set up to activate allowing the user to adjust any values on the due date

 Itâ€™s possible to achieve a high level of schedule customization:
