MMEX allows to import and export data from different file types.

Supported formats are:

- QIF ([Quicken Interchange Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicken_Interchange_Format))
- CSV ([Comma-Separated Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values))
- HTML ([HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML))
- XML ([eXtensible Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML))

To alleviate the problem of users having to pre-format their bank transaction CSV files into the fixed format that software requires, MMEX allows users to import CSV files where the order of fields is completely freeform. To use this importer, select the order of fields in the CSV file by picking and choosing from the list of possible fields. MMEX will then import the CSV file using the format information specified by the user.
